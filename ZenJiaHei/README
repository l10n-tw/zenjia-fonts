FONTLOG for ZenJiaHei 0.0.1
=================================

This file provides detailed information on the ZenJiaHei font
software. This information should be distributed along with the
ZenJiaHei fonts and any derivative works.

Font Information
-------------------------

The ZenJiaHei typeface family is a contemporary sans 
serif for users of Han characters.

ZenJiaHei is a derivative work from Cantarell and 
cwTeXQHeiZH-Bold. It combined Han characters part of 
cwTeXQHeiZH-Bold with Cantarell.

Cantarell was originally designed by Dave Crossland as part 
of his coursework for the MA Typeface Design programme at 
the Department of Typography in the University of Reading, 
England. [1] 

The fonts were initially published on the 6th of July 2009 on
Dave Crossland's foundry website [2] under the terms of the GNU
 General Public License version 3. [3] In May 2010 the fonts were 
republished through Google Web Fonts [4] under the terms of the
 SIL Open Font License version 1.1. [5] 

cwTeX Chinese fonts were originally published as Type 1 fonts 
along with cwTeX system, [6] and created by Tsong-Min Wu and 
Tsong-Huey Wu. Later Edward G.J. Lee converted those fonts into 
TrueType fonts and discussed with Tsong-Min Wu about the license 
issue. They decided to use GPL license on 16th of Dec 2004. In 
order to cover Western characters, CM-LGC Type 1 font by Alexej 
Kryukov was merged on 21st of Dec 2004. And they merged Koanughi 
Un's Un-Fonts to cover Korean syllables 27th of Dec 2004. The 
final work of cwTeX Chinese fonts, including cwTeXMing, cwTeXKai, 
cwTeXFangSong, cwTeXYen and cwTeXHeiBold, were published on 10th 
of Jan 2005. Chen-Pan Liao later forked cwTeX fonts as 
cwtex-q-fonts project since 2008. He tweaked character widths of 
Han characters and symbols to improve the quality.

Cantarell is used by the GNOME project for its user interface, 
but the default Chinese fonts such as WenQuanYi Zen Hei, 
WenQuanYi Micro Hei and AR PL UMing provided by major Linux 
distributions cannot match the style well. Cheng-Chia Tseng 
did an study and found that Han characters provided by 
cwTeXHeiBold derived fonts could match Cantarell best, and 
he published a post on this issue on his blogger. [7] As a 
result, he decided to combine those two fonts together to 
provide best experiment for Han Characters users.

Later releases of Cantarell are distributed under OFL 1.1 
and not compatible with GPL. Cheng-Chia Tseng sent an e-mail 
to the copyright holders of Han characters of cwTeX Chinese fonts 
to discuss this license issue on 20th of Feb 2014, and they agreed
 with the idea to license Han characters part of cwTeX Chinese 
fonts under the terms of  OFL 1.1. Chen-Pan Liao agreed the move
to OFL, and released cwTeXQHeiZH-Bold under OFL on 10th of Jul 
2014[8]. The new combination font composed of Cantarell and 
cwTeXQHeiZH-Bold is named as “ZenJia Hei”. The initial release of 
ZenJiaHei was published on 10th of Sep 2014.

Cantarell
------------
             
The original src/Cantarell-Regular.sfd file has the master sources 
as Cubic (PostScript) Bezier splines. There are temporary layers 
and a 'Spiro' layer in this file, containing forms used to create 
the master Cubic Bezier glyphs; the Spiro layer contains forms in 
Spiro splines, and much of the original typeface design by Dave
Crossland was done by drawing in Spiro splines. However today the
master drawing spline format is Cubic Bezier, and Spiro splines
are used to inform their creation.
