	<h1>Cantarell</h1>
</div>


<!-- HEADINGS, LISTS, EMPHASIS -->
<div class="grid_8">
	<h2>Headings, lists, and emphasis</h2>
	<p><span>15/22</span>For decades, critics have predicted the end of the
 written word: “No one reads anymore! No one writes anymore!” Yet from 
birth certificates to gravestones, from T-shirts to text messaging, the 
written word—and thus reading—is woven into the fabric of our everyday 
lives.</p>
	
<div id="testing_text">
	<h3>Same <em>font</em> set large for a <strong>heading</strong></h3>
	<p>Throughout history, we have used the written word to record and preserve who we are and what we care about: <span class="bolditalic">possessions, laws, commitments, ideas, and memories.</span> Words and characters, once impressed in clay, written on papyrus, and printed with ink, are now manifest in pixels of light.</p>
</div>

	<ul>
	  	<li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ex laudem corrumpit </li>
	  	<li>Uui et ridens nemore vituperata, eos probo verear luptatum ad eos tractatos persequeris</li>
	  	<li>Te ius tamquam voluptua, eu velit definiebas</li>
	  	<li>Nam suas regione quaestio ei, an sea facilis fastidii nominavi aeterno platonem ei duo.</li>
	</ul>
	<ol>
	  	<li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ex laudem corrumpit</li>
	  	<li>Uui et ridens nemore vituperata, eos probo verear luptatum ad eos tractatos persequeris</li>
	  	<li>Te ius tamquam voluptua, eu velit definiebas</li>
	  	<li>Nam suas regione quaestio ei, an sea facilis fastidii nominavi aeterno platonem ei duo.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h4>Same font in loosely spaced all caps</h4>
	<p>The use of text messaging for casual conversation has exploded, 
surpassing phone conversation as the communication method of 
choice—suggesting our personal connection to reading and writing 
continues to thrive. </p>
	
	<h6><em>Same font set as larger italic (if available) heading</em></h6>
	<p>People read. they seek connection to their community, answers to 
their questions, lessons to augment their skills, and new ideas to 
influence their lives. People may not participate in sustained reading 
the way they used to (or the way we think they used to), but people 
read. They text, tweet, and post on Facebook. They search for things 
they need or want to know. They get lost in stories. People read what is
 important to them.
</p>
	<p><em>If we define reading only as a sustained and literary activity, 
if we acknowledge only one kind of reading, we measure ourselves against
 a fabricated truth. We ignore the actual activity and exclude people’s 
needs and desires. </em></p>
	
	<h5><strong>Same font set as bold (if available) heading</strong></h5>
	<p>The truth is there are different ways to read, and they are all 
valid and important. As typographers, we can support them all. Choosing a
 legible, readable web font is a good start.</p>
